                        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages in accordance with
                        general laws persuant to section 7(1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).
                        However, according to §§ 8 to 10 (TMG), we are not obliged as a service provider to monitor
                        transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
                        illegal activity.
                        Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain
                        unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at
                        which a concrete
                        infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of corresponding infringements, we
                        will remove this content immediately.

                    <p>
                        With regard to the data processing described in more detail below, users and data subjects have
                        the right to confirmation as to whether data relating to them are being processed, to
                        information about the data being processed, to further information about the data processing and
                        to copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR); to correction or completion of incorrect or
                        incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR); to immediate erasure of the data relating to them (cf.
                        also Art. 17 GDPR), or, alternatively, if further processing is required pursuant to Art. 17(3)
                        GDPR, to restriction of processing in accordance with Art. 18 GDPR; to receive the data
                        concerning them and provided by them and to transfer this data to other providers/controllers
                        (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR); to complain to the supervisory authority if they are of the opinion
                        that the data concerning them is being processed by the provider in breach of data protection
                        provisions (cf. also Art. 77 GDPR). In addition, the provider is obliged to inform all
                        recipients to whom data has been disclosed by the provider of any correction or deletion of data
                        or restriction of processing that takes place on the basis of Articles 16, 17 (1), 18 DSGVO.
                        However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
                        disproportionate effort. Notwithstanding this, the user has a right to information about these
                        recipients. Likewise, according to Art. 21 DSGVO, users and data subjects have the right to
                        object to the future processing of data concerning them, insofar as the data is processed by the
                        provider in accordance with Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DSGVO. In particular, an objection to data
                        processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible. </p>

                        III. Information on data processing
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your data processed when using our website will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of
                        the storage no longer applies, the deletion of the data does not conflict with any statutory
                        retention obligations and no other information on individual processing procedures is provided
                        below.
